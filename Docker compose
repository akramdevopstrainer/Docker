# Docker Compose Installation SOP

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing Docker Compose on Linux systems.

## Prerequisites

- Linux operating system

## Steps

1. Check if Docker Compose is already installed by running the following command:

   ```shell
   docker-compose --version
   ```

   If Docker Compose is not installed, proceed to the next step.

2. Install Docker Compose by running the following commands:

   ```shell
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

   These commands download the latest Docker Compose release and make it executable.

3. Verify the installation by running `docker-compose --version` again. You should see the version information for Docker Compose if the installation was successful.

4. Ensure that the directory containing the `docker-compose` executable is included in the system's `PATH` environment variable. This allows you to run the `docker-compose` command from any location.

   - Open the shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) using a text editor.

   - Append the following line to the file if it doesn't exist:

     ```shell
     export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
     ```

   - Save the file and exit the text editor.

   - Run the following command to reload the configuration:

     ```shell
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

     Replace `~/.bashrc` with the appropriate file if you modified a different shell configuration file.

5. Docker Compose is now installed and ready to use. You can verify its functionality by running `docker-compose --version` again and confirming the output.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation process or while using Docker Compose, refer to the official Docker Compose documentation or seek support from the Docker community.

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed Docker Compose on your Linux system. Docker Compose allows you to manage multi-container Docker applications with ease using YAML configuration files. You can now proceed with deploying and orchestrating your Docker-based projects efficiently.

You can save the above content into a README.md file in your Git repository and customize it further if needed.
