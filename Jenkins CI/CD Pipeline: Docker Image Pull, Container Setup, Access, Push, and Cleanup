## Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline SOP

This SOP outlines the steps to pull the Jenkins image, run it as a container, access it via browser, and push a new image to Docker Hub.

### Step 1: Pull Jenkins Image

Pull the Jenkins image from Docker Hub using the following command:

```
docker pull jenkins/jenkins
```

### Step 2: Rename the Image

Rename the pulled Jenkins image to `jenkins-cicd:1.0` using the following command:

```
docker image tag jenkins/jenkins jenkins-cicd:1.0
```

### Step 3: Run Jenkins Container

Run the Jenkins container by mapping port 8080 on the host to port 8080 in the container using the following command:

```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name jenkins-container jenkins-cicd:1.0
```

### Step 4: Login to Jenkins Container and Get Initial Password

Access the Jenkins container's shell by running the following command:

```
docker exec -it jenkins-container /bin/bash
```

Once inside the container, retrieve the Jenkins initial password by executing the following command:

```
cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

Make a note of the displayed password for later use.

### Step 5: Exit Jenkins Container

Exit the Jenkins container by typing `exit` in the container shell.

### Step 6: Get Public IP of EC2 Instance

Retrieve the public IP of the EC2 instance using the following command:

```
curl ifconfig.me
```

Make a note of the displayed public IP for accessing Jenkins.

### Step 7: Accessing Jenkins via Browser

Open a web browser and enter the following URL:

```
http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8080
```

Replace `<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>` with the actual public IP obtained in the previous step.

### Step 8: Stop Jenkins Container

Stop the running Jenkins container using the following command:

```
docker stop jenkins-container
```

### Step 9: Convert Stopped Container to a New Image

Convert the stopped Jenkins container to a new image with the name `jenkins:2.0` using the following command:

```
docker commit jenkins-container jenkins:2.0
```

### Step 10: Push New Image to Docker Hub

Push the newly created `jenkins:2.0` image to Docker Hub by tagging and pushing it using the following commands:

```
docker image tag jenkins:2.0 <YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/jenkins:2.0
docker push <YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/jenkins:2.0
```

Replace `<YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>` with your Docker Hub username.

### Step 11: Delete Jenkins Image

Delete the local `jenkins:2.0` image using the following command:

```
docker image rm jenkins:2.0
```

---

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline SOP.

```

Please note that you should replace `<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>` and `<YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>` with the actual values specific to your environment.
