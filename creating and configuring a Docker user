# Creating and Configuring a Docker User

## Objective
The objective of this lab is to create and configure a Docker user, allowing students to practice Docker commands with appropriate permissions.

## Prerequisites
- Access to a Red Hat Linux Version 9 system.
- Administrative privileges or access to the root user.

## Procedure

1. Log in to the Red Hat Linux Version 9 system using your provided credentials.

2. Open a terminal or command line interface.

3. Set up the Docker User:
   ```
   sudo -i
   useradd -m docker-cicd
   passwd docker-cicd
   usermod -aG docker docker-cicd
   ```

4. Verify the User Creation:
   ```
   cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd | sort
   ```

5. Verify Docker Group Membership:
   ```
   grep '^docker:' /etc/group | cut -d: -f4 | tr ',' '\n'
   ```

6. Switch to the Docker User:
   ```
   exit
   su - docker-cicd
   ```

7. Test Docker Functionality:
   ```
   docker run hello-world
   ```

## Conclusion
In this lab, you have successfully created and configured a Docker user named "docker-cicd." 
The user has been added to the "docker" group, allowing them to run Docker commands with the necessary permissions. 
You have verified the user creation, group membership, and tested Docker functionality. 
The "docker-cicd" user is now ready to perform Docker-related tasks in the lab environment.
